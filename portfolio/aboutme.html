                <p>Hello, I’m Ashley Zhuang! I feel like you probably aren’t too interested in reading about me, but I’m going to tell you about me anyways. Sorry.</p>
                <p>I’m a senior at Granada High School (but this website will probably continue saying that i’m a senior for the rest of my life because I doubt I’ll update it after finishing AP CSP). I get excited over small things, such as not even realizing that “Cool Space Pics” has the acronym of CSP until the day this website was due!! I enjoy eating food, drinking boba, doing physics, coding, dancing, and contributing to all the different communities to which I belong (I wish I could end sentences with prepositions; it makes it sound so awkward when I’m trying not to). I feel like you’re probably not reading this anymore, so I’m going to stop here. SIKE no I’m not. Uh I have a lot of work to do bleh college apps bleh so much work and when I finish it I just get more work and it’s just an endless cycle of having work to do and I feel like I’m just pursuing unattainable goals and why do I even need to go to college what if I just ran away from society and lived on my own yikes that probably wouldn’t work but i just hate that I can’t figure out how to succeed in society without yielding to the constraints society places on me. Okay bye!</p>
